# Kaggle Census Entry

This is my Kaggle solution work in progress.

> This is a competition for a Kaggle hack night at the Cincinnati machine learning 
> meetup. It uses the Census Income dataset; click the Data tab for more 
> information and to download the data.

# Objective

We want to predict if a person has income greater than 50k/year or less based
on various demographic features.

# Results

How did I do? Not great. My first solution was to say all people make less than
$50k/yr. This got me to 76% accuracy, even though it was pretty dumb. My second
attempt uses PCA and a Decision Tree Regressor, and only got 78%. What's next?
